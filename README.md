# Project 3: Personal Website

## Project Description
For this project you are tasked with creating a personal website for a historical or fictional
character.
Design, write, and develop a website that represents a historical or fictional individual. Create a
design that matches who this individual is, what they are all about, and how they fit in to greater
narratives. Attempt to make a connecition with the audience by the way you design and write a
representation of this individual.

## Hayao Miyazaki
My websites will be about Hayao Miyazaki,  the world famous filmmaker who co-founded studio ghibli and created many classic films such as My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited away. I think Miyazaki will be a good subject for this project because his well established aesthetic of magic and animation will be fun to build and create from. Additionally he is extremely well known and widely considered one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation so there is a lot of content to choose from and use to create this website.
